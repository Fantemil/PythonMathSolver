# PythonMathSolver
This is my first ever Python project! I made this Project to make calculating with formulas easy

# What Can it do?
The PythonMathSolver can currently only calculate formulas in Physics because its in early development.
The third option in Kinetic Energy isnt available yet!

# How to
Mac OS:
- Open a new terminal
- If not done already install homebrew
- /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
- or
- /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
- Install python3
- brew install python3
- Install git
- brew install git
- Installing the script
- git clone https://github.com/Fantemil/PythonMathSolver
- cd PythonMathSolver
- python3 PythonMathSolver.py

There you go

Windows:
- i don't have a Windows Machine but it should be like that:
- Install python3 from the official Website
- Open CMD or PowerShell
- Start python3 by writing "python3"
- if no Error shows up you should be fine
- Download the Code
- Extract the Zip
- in Powershell/CMD type "python3 PythonMathSolver.py"
- Thats it!

Linux:
For Linux its the same procedure like Mac OS but instead of using Homebrew use your Package manager like apt. Mostly git and python3 are preinstalled so just do the last 2 steps.
